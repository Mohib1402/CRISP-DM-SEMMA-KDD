# **Principled Data Science with CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD**

This repository contains a detailed exploration of three popular data science methodologies: **CRISP-DM**, **SEMMA**, and **KDD**. Each methodology is demonstrated using a unique dataset and includes:
- Jupyter Colab notebooks for implementation
- Research papers in both LaTeX and PDF formats
- Medium articles summarizing the projects

## **Project Overview**
This repository demonstrates the **principled, phase-by-phase execution of data science projects** using:
1. CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
2. SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess)
3. KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)

For each methodology:
- We selected a dataset that aligns with the respective process.
- Implemented the methodology end-to-end, from data preparation to evaluation.
- Documented the findings through research papers and Medium articles.
